This is team 1's project for the nonprofit organization, Nemours.
This web app is designed to help kids, more specifically austitic kids, prepare for what may happen at their hospital check up.
Kids will be able to read social stories made to relax their anxiety and reduce chances of the patient feeling like they're going into a place completely unrecognizable.
